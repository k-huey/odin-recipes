    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Taiwanese pork chop recipe has a great flavor using five-spice powder. If you can find sweet potato powder, use it instead of cornstarch. Serve this with plain white rice and a simple vegetable side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (3/4 inch) thick bone-in pork chops</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon white wine</li>
            <li>½ tablespoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
            <li>cornstarch</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>With a sharp knife, make several small slits near the edges of the pork chops to keep them from curling when fried.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, garlic, sugar, white wine, and five-spice powder in a large resealable plastic bag. Place chops into the bag and seal tightly. Carefully massage chops until well coated with marinade. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, turning the bag over every so often.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat enough vegetable oil to fill the skillet to a depth of about 1/2 inch. Remove chops from resealable bag without wiping off marinade. Lightly sprinkle cornstarch on both sides of the chops.</li>
            <li>Carefully add chops to skillet; cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides and cooked through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
