    <h1>Taiwanese-Style Three Cup Chicken</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Three Cup Chicken, or “San Bei Ji” (三杯鸡) is a popular standard dish in Chinese and Taiwanese cuisine. The name refers to the recipe used to make it: A cup each of the three ingredients that create the sauce: rice wine, soy sauce, and sesame oil. It’s kind of reminiscent of why pound cake is called pound cake––traditional recipes used a pound each of flour, eggs, butter, and sugar. You’ll notice, however, that our version isn’t exactly using three whole cups of anything. That 3 cup chicken recipe must have been for a BOATLOAD of chicken.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into chunks</li>
                <li>½ cup sesame oil</li>
                <li>10 slices fresh ginger</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, sliced</li>
                <li>½ cup Chinese rice wine</li>
                <li>⅓ cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>¼ cup water</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup fresh Thai basil leaves</li>
                <li>3 dried whole red chilies</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat sesame oil in the same skillet. Add ginger and garlic; cook and stir until ginger begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Stir in reserved chicken, rice wine, soy sauce, water, and sugar; bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until there is only 1/4 cup of liquid left in the skillet, about 20 minutes.</li>   
                <li>Stir in basil and chiles; increase heat to medium and continue cooking until liquid is almost gone.</li>
            </ol>
